Demo Project

This is the demo project to guide the students of how to use the GITHUB

 (check out the guide https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Basically, there are five important steps.

1. create a GITHUB personal account


2. Create and use a repository

3. Start and manage a new branch

4. Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits


5. Open and merge a pull request

This is my review copy, and for demo purpose, more demo will coming soon.
